# The Story of Hotswap
In the beginning there was the Slippi replay.
This perfect digital representation of a game of Melee became the basis of modern netplay and production, but consoles did not see the same benefits at first.
A few TOs diligently uploaded full dumps, hundreds of files at a time, amounting to gigabytes of replays rarely touched.
Only the most dedicated preservationists and players attempted to sort through these vast archives, winnowing out handwarmers and friendlies, searching for the right nametag or port or character or color.
And all that only to review a set on PC or maybe record a clip to post to Twitter.

However, there is now a better way.

The shortcoming of the Slippi replay is that they work **per-game**, while much of console Melee is played **per-set**.
Now, USB hotswap in Slippi Nintendont makes it practical to collect replays per-set.
With Replay Manager for Slippi we can add player names, scores, and information about the set all while reporting the result to start.gg in the same amount of time.
The result is replays grouped and labelled by set, packaged together with all relevant context, henceforth referred to as *Per-Set Replays*.
