# Full Autoboot
Full autoboot means pressing the Wii POWER button and walking away while it boots all the way into Melee.
Of course this is very useful to TOs.
To get set up full autoboot you will need:
- [Slippi Nintendont](https://github.com/project-slippi/Nintendont/releases/latest), v1.13.0 (April 2025) or later.
This version included a fix for a bug that could cause launching Melee to get stuck on a black screen before reaching the game.
- Forwarder for Slippi Nintendont, which is included in the Slippi Nintendont download.
- [Priiloader](https://github.com/DacoTaco/priiloader/releases/latest), download the installer (at time of writing `Priiloader_v0_10.zip`).
If your installed Priiloader version is too old this won't work, so if you have problems try installing the latest version.

After running the Priiloader installer via Homebrew Channel, access Priiloader settings by holding the Wii RESET button while powering on.

Select `Load/Install File`:

Select `Forwarder for Slippi Nintendont`:

Change `Autoboot` to `Installed File`, then select `save settings`:

Hold the Wii POWER button until the console turns off, then turn it back on and verify that Priiloader Autoboot takes you to Slippi Nintendont.

In Slippi Nintendont once all your `Slippi Settings` are set, press L or R to access the second page, `Nintendont Settings`.
Change `Auto Boot` to `On`:

Press B to return to the games list and launch Melee.
Full autoboot is now set up.

Holding the Wii RESET button while powering on will still access Priiloader settings, interrupting Priiloader Autoboot.

You can cancel Slippi Nintendont Auto Boot by pressing B when prompted.
However, doing this turns Slippi Nintendont `Auto Boot` `Off` so be sure to turn it back on when you're ready.
